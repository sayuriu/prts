We hope all our friends in the city able to adopt will jump at the opportunity to give these homeless little ones a chance at a brand new life.\nOf course, those who aren't in a position to adopt can still contribute by offering cans of pet food, not to mention the splendid gifts awaiting anyone who donates.",
