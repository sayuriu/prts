	"description": "A luxurious, but completely meaningless, golden medal created by the most esteemed goldsmiths in Lungmen. You'll be hard pressed to find anything more limited than this in all of Terra. It's clearly a cup, but still called a medal, and it symbolizes the highest praise of the Emperor. Each sip is worth a thousand bucks, but don't use it to make hot coffee!",
